## Professional Telegram Bot

This is a professional Telegram bot developed using the `telegram/bot` and `teleglass` libraries. It provides information and assistance to users.

## Getting Started

To use this bot, you need to have a Telegram Bot API token. Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` in the code with your actual bot API token.

You also need to define the channel ID that users need to join in order to use the bot. Replace `@your_channel_username` with your actual channel username.

## Features

Once a user joins the required channel, the bot provides the following features:

- `/start` command: Displays a welcome message and asks for user's request.
- `/help` command: Displays the help section with available commands.
- `/about` command: Displays information about the bot.
- Default response: If the user sends a message other than the above commands, the bot sends a default response suggesting the user to use `/help` command.

## Implementation Details

The code checks if a user has joined the required channel using the `user_joined_channel?` method. If the user hasn't joined, the bot asks the user to join the channel by sending a message with a button. The button redirects the user to the channel.

The methods `send_welcome_message`, `send_help_message`, `send_about_message`, and `send_default_response` handle the respective functionality when the user interacts with the bot.

## Example Usage

To use this bot, follow these steps:

1. Replace `YOUR_API_TOKEN` with your Telegram Bot API token.
2. Replace `@your_channel_username` with your actual channel username.
3. Run the code to start the Telegram bot.
4. Join the required channel using the button provided by the bot.
5. Interact with the bot using the available commands.

Contributions to this project are welcome. Feel free to make any improvements or add more features to enhance the bot's usability.

Happy botting!
